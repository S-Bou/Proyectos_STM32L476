STM32Cube Firmware for STM32L4 series

Don't put that firmware in this folder, it is too big.
In order to avoid this, the template has been configurated to assume that it is stored in the unit "O:".

You can provide a virtual unit "O:" that point to the real firmware following this procedure:
- Go to "Inicio->Todos los programas->Inicio" and right-click on "Inicio" to select "Abrir".
- In the open folder, right-click and select "Nuevo->Acceso directo"
- In the openned dialog, write "cmd" for the command and pres "Intro".
- Right-clic the created icon and elect "Propiedades"
- In field "Destino" add the following text: %windir%\system32\cmd.exe /c "subst P: C:\STMicroelectronics\STM32Cube-Repository\STM32Cube_FW_L4_V1.9.0"
where C:\... must be replaced with the path for your own machine
- Click on the newly created icon. This should create the unit "O:\"
- Chechk the correct creation of the new disk unit "o:", openning the file explorer

If your "O:" is busy, you can adapt yourself the path. Check the contents of files "MDK-ARM/Project.uvoptx" and "MDK-ARM/Project.uvprojx" for finding and replacing "o:\" with your desired path.

Sorry for this trick. Keil does not provide good solutions for that.
